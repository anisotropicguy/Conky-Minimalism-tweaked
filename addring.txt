add entry to settings table to customise your rings.
don't forget the {} brackets and the , !!!
-- You can create more rings simply by adding more elements to settings_table.
-- "name" is the type of stat to display; you can choose from 'cpu', 'memperc', 'fs_used_perc', 'battery_used_perc'.
name='time',
    -- "arg" is the argument to the stat type, e.g. if in Conky you would write ${cpu cpu0}, 'cpu0' would be the argument. If you would not use an argument in the Conky variable, use ''.
    arg='%I.%M',
    -- "max" is the maximum value of the ring. If the Conky variable outputs a percentage, use 100.
    max=12,
    -- "bg_colour" is the colour of the base ring.
    bg_colour=0xffffff,
    -- "bg_alpha" is the alpha value of the base ring.
    bg_alpha=0.1,
    -- "fg_colour" is the colour of the indicator part of the ring.
    fg_colour=0xFF6600,
    -- "fg_alpha" is the alpha value of the indicator part of the ring.
    fg_alpha=0.2,
    -- "x" and "y" are the x and y coordinates of the centre of the ring, relative to the top left corner of the Conky window.
    x=100, y=150,
    -- "radius" is the radius of the ring.
    radius=50,
    -- "thickness" is the thickness of the ring, centred around the radius.
    thickness=5,
    -- "start_angle" is the starting angle of the ring, in degrees, clockwise from top. Value can be either positive or negative.
    start_angle=0,
    -- "end_angle" is the ending angle of the ring, in degrees, clockwise from top. Value can be either positive or negative, but must be larger than start_angle.
    end_angle=360
